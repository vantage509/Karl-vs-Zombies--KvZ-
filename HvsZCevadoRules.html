The Humans win by surviving long enough for all of the zombies to starve. The game is over when one side is completely eliminated, or when the time limit expires (2 week maximum).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Safety</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Rules</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br></span><span>- No realistic looking weaponry<br>- Players may not use cars<br>- Darts must not hurt on impact<br>- Players may not engage in the game while crossing the street<br>- No running indoors</span><span><br>-</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Z</span><span>o</span><span>mbies can never run (the weapons of a zombie are trickery and stealth, not speed)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Equipment (required for all players)</span><span><br>- </span><span>Colored wristbands (H=green, Z=red</span><span>)<br>- Nerf gun and/or clean socks<br>- One business card/post-it with your </span><span>player ID</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Safety</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Zones (</span><span class="c0">p</span><span class="c0">layers are safe in the following areas)</span><span><br>- Offices / Cubicles / Sitting at desk<br>- Bathrooms<br>- Meetings </span><span>or</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>a</span><span>ctive </span><span>t</span><span>ech </span><span>t</span><span>alks<br>- </span><span>Vehicl</span><span>es are considered safe zones<br>- Upon disembarking the </span><span>vehicle</span><span>, you are safe until the </span><span>door is closed</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Human Rules</span><span><br>- Business Card: Humans must keep one business card with them at all times<br>- Identification: Humans must wear a green </span><span>wristband</span><span>. This identifies you to other players as a Human, it must remain visible at all times<br>- Stunning a Zombie: Humans may stun a Zombie for 15 minutes by shooting them with a Nerf gun or hitting them with a sock<br>- When Tagged By a Zombie: When tagged by a Zombie, a Human is required to yield their </span><span>player id number</span><span>&nbsp;as a trophy. Please sign and date the card for record keeping. One hour after being tagged, the Human becomes a member of the Zombie team. Replace the green </span><span>wristband</span><span>&nbsp;with a red </span><span>wristband </span><span>- you are now allowed to tag other Humans</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Zombie Rules</span><span class="c0"><br></span><span>- </span><span>Feeding: Zombies must feed every 48 hours (weekends do not count). A zombie feeds by tagging a Human and reporting their kill on the website<br>- Identification: Zombies must wear a red </span><span>wristband</span><span>. This identifies you to other players as a Zombie, it must remain visible at all times. The Original Zombie does not need to wear </span><span>a wristband.</span><span>&nbsp;<br>- Tagging: A tag is a firm touch to any part of a Human (but remember your Keeping it Legal training). After tagging a Human, the Zombie must collect the</span><span>&nbsp;human&rsquo;s</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>id</span><span>&nbsp;card as a trophy. Kills must be reported within three hours on the Humans vs Zombies site.<br>- Getting Shot: When shot with a Nerf gun or hit with a sock a Zombie is stunned for 15 minutes. A stunned zombie may not interact with the game in any way. This includes shielding other zombies from bullets or continuing to run toward a Human. If shot while stunned, a zombie remains stunned for the next 15 minutes. Stunned zombies may continue with business related activities.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Other Rules</span><span>&nbsp;<br>- People who are not registered participants may not directly interact with the game. This includes bringing food to Humans, or spying for either team. <br>- A zombie must have both feet outside of a safe zone to tag a Human.<br>- Zombies may not use shields to deflect Nerf darts or socks.<br>- Humans are safe during meetings (normal and all-hands), but not while in transit.<br>- Humans can stun zombies from inside a safe-zone </span><span>(to prevent zombies from blocking exits).</span><span><br>- No playing in the street (si</span><span>dewalks are ok)</span><span><br>- Humans are safe when off-campus</span><span><br>- Truce Rule: If a human and a zombie wish to interact outside the game (for a game of pool or hacky sack), they may create a truce. However, the truce doesn&rsquo;t extend to other zombies, so the human must remain on guard</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Recent rule clarifications: <br>- A meeting room is a safe zone for both zombies and Humans both before and after a meeting they attend there. They are vulnerable before they arrive at the room and after they leave.<br>- Provided a zombie is out of a safe zone, a Human can shoot the zombie (with a sock or dart gun) even if the Human is in the safe zone . <br>- Even if a Human is out of a safe zone, the zombie must have both feet outside the safe zone to feed (this prevents the zombie from blocking an exit by waiting just inside the door to the exit of a safe zone). <br>- No RUNNING inside.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Future rule ideas: <br>- To prevent fast walks escalating into running, a zombie should get in character during a chase and shamble or drag a leg or the like. </span><span><br>- Zombies can share their tags?</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span></span></p><sup><a href="#cmnt1" name="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><div class="c7"><p class="c6"><a href="#cmnt_ref1" name="cmnt1">[a]</a><span>Travis F:</span></p><p class="c6"><span>Added &quot;Truce Rule&quot; and added wristbands as identifier</span></p></div></body></html>
